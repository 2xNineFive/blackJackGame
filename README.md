This project is... a game of black jack! 

I started the project by cloning a repo from my instructors' GitHub. Then, I pulled the repo to Git so I could work on it locally. 

I started off trying to style the page in CSS, but I was not able get it done efficiently. So I just grabbed the style from my instructors' GitHub, added it to my repo, and committed it to my repo. 

My next step was to start the javascript program for my game. I tried following the instructions, but I was really lost. I understand what I want to do. I just struggle writing out my thoughts in Javascript. And that does not stop me. 

I am not one to give up, so I Googled "How to Make a Black Jack Game." I skimmed through several articles and Youtube videos until I found a video that I liked. I followed along by coding the program, and I am surprised that I actually understand what is going on. When I didn't understand something, I played with the code to try to understand it. I learned so much--- and my self-esteem took off to the moon! 

But I am back to earth now. I am going to reference the code I wrote and experimented with and adapt it to this project. My instructors created HTML and JS documents with pre-written code. I am going to try to understand it--- and make my program work!
